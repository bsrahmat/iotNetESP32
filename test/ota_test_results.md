## Conclusion

The OTA update testing demonstrates that the IoTNet system successfully performs firmware updates with consistent resource usage and reliability:

1. **Reliability**: All 10 update tests were successfully completed without any failures, indicating robust OTA implementation.

2. **Resource Efficiency**:

   - Memory usage remained consistent across updates, with maximum heap usage consistently around 24% of available memory.
   - Stack usage was stable with 284 bytes remaining in all tests.
   - CPU utilization peaked at approximately 75% during most updates, which indicates efficient processing while leaving resources for critical system functions.

3. **Performance**:

   - For full firmware updates (~974KB), the average update time was approximately 21.67 seconds.
   - The average memory allocation rate for regular firmware was around 2,062.92 bytes/second.

4. **Consistency**:

   - The system demonstrated consistent performance metrics across multiple update cycles.
   - Post-update memory state (final heap) was consistently around 140,800 bytes across all tests.

5. **Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Implementation of partial/differential updates could potentially improve performance.
   - Memory management appears effective, with consistent recovery of heap space after updates.

Overall, the IoTNet OTA update system demonstrates excellent reliability, consistent performance, and efficient resource usage, making it suitable for production deployment in IoT environments. The ability to handle multiple consecutive updates without degradation in performance suggests good system stability and resilience.
